I noticed in Ubuntu 14.04 that you can quickly switch between recursive search and type-ahead find on the Unity UI. As someone who is still learning the ropes of grep, I find the UI search to be useful at times.

Recursive Search (Searches current folder and all sub-directories)

```ruby
gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search false
```
Type-ahead Find
Selects a name or directory without searching in the sub-directories

```ruby
gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search true
```
