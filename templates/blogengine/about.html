      <h1>About me<span>Why Engineering   </span></h1>
        <p class = "about-eric"> Ever since I was little, I was very tech-savvy. Like many kids in my generation, I played on my Nintendo DS and computer games religiously every week. Naturally, I started liking computers, setting them up, finding new ways to use them, and eventually in getting more performance out of them. Through elementary school and high school, my old premade computer no longer had the horsepower to run the latest video games. Over the course of a year, I procured computer parts in any way I could and built my first computer. From there, working on computers became a passion of mine, by 12th grade, I had built two computer for myself and a few for friends. After high school, I embarked on my next adventure enrolling in the Mechatronics Engineering co-op program at the University of Waterloo. To this day, I have a hard time explaining what mechatronics engineering is to non-engineers but think of it this way, most systems these days are not longer purely mechanical, they are electromechanical. I naturally progressed from computers to robots and these days you will find me working on different robotic platforms ranging from kits to designed and built from first principles.

      <h1>My Blog<span>Everyone's a teacher and a learner</span></h1>
      <p class = "about-eric">My teachers were by far the people who shaped my life in the biggest way. The most important things I took out of school is not the calculus or the physics but instead the life lessons. I believe that everyone is both a teacher and a learner. I however have a huge passion for teaching. I did lots of tutoring in the past and most recently, I started running my own blog. I have a vision for my blog and I want it to eventually be a good resource for people in elementary and high school to get into robotics outside of school. My school had no robotic program and I missed out. </p>
